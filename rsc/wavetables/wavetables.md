# Vibe uses this file to keep track of its wavetables.  
#  
# Generally, do not touch this file unless you are 99%  
# of what you are doing and backup before making any  
# changes.  
#  
# The order of the names is just as important as the naming  
# itself. Vibe might not find the correct binary files or  
# play a square wave when you actually want a triangle wave  
# or something similar if you mess up.  
#  
# This file is internally parsed. Everything is read except  
# for blanks and lines starting with a "#".
